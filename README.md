### OC / Project 5

This fifth project of my training program consists in building an e-commerce site in javascript.

### Project installation

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You
can then run the server with `node server`.
